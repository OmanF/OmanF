# Hi there 👋

I'm Ohad Frenkel Keshet.

- 🕵️ QA professional for a double-digit number of years.
  - 🤖 Most of which as a Software Developer in Test (SDET)/automation developer.
  - 👁️ I still participate in manual QA activites, e.g., manually testing features, design and document test plans, etc.
- 💻️ Love the Functional Programming (FP) paradigm, especially F#, Haskell, and Elixir, with a warm spot in my heart for Clojure too.
- 📊 Also interested in multi-paradigm databases, such as SurrealDB and ArangoDB.
- 🦾 Hobby-coder, currently mostly in F#.
- 🤣 An all-around stand-up guy.

Thanks for dropping by!
