# Hi there 👋

I'm Ohad Frenkel Keshet.

- 🕵️ A QA professional for a double-digit number of years.
- 👨‍💻 Most of which as a Software Developer in Test, though I still participate in, and enjoy, manual QA activites (manually testing features, design and document test plans, etc.), too.
- 🤖 Love the Functional Programming (FP) paradigm, especially F#, Haskell, and Elixir, with a warm spot in my heart for Clojure too.
- 📊 Also interested in multi-paradigm, graph databases, such as SurrealDB and ArangoDB.
- 🦾 Hobby-coder, currently mostly in F#.
- 🤣 An all-around stand-up guy.

Thanks for dropping by, and enjoy! 😄
